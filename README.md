# Python Project: Range Image Generator, Background Extractor, Feature Extractor, and SVM Classifier

## Overview

This project consists of four main components:
1. **Range Image Generator**: Generates range images from input data.
2. **Background Extractor**: Uses Mask R-CNN to extract the background from images.
3. **Feature Extractor**: Extracts features from images for classification.
4. **SVM Classifier**: Classifies images based on the extracted features using a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with several libraries. You can install the required packages using pip.
